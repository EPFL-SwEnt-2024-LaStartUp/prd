*Describe the V1 POC as planned by Sprint10.*

The v1 Proof of Concept (PoC) for TripAdvisor build during the semester is a mobile application that allow users to create walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city. 
The application offers a social and interactive platform where users can record their own paths, add points of interest, and share their recorded paths with other users. 
It also proposes a following system to enable users to connect with their friends and share their paths with them.

The PoC was designed to enhance the experience of visiting a city by providing users with pleasant walking itineraries around spots of interest.

From the V1 Proof of Concept we learned several valuable lessons.

The PoC is a great starting point to test the concept and gather feedback from users.
