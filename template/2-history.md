*Describe the V1 POC as planned by Sprint10.*

The v1 Proof of Concept (PoC) for TripAdvisor build during the semester is a mobile application that 
allow users to create walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city. The application offers 
a social and interactive platform where users can record their own paths, add points of interest, 
and share their recorded paths with other users. It also proposes a following system to enable users 
to connect with their friends and share their paths with them.

The PoC was designed to enhance the experience of visiting a city by providing users with pleasant 
walking itineraries around spots of interest.


*What did you learn?*

From the V1 Proof of Concept we learned several valuable lessons.
- security and privacy
- importance of user feedback
- performance optimization
- importance of a good ui


*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

The PoC is a great starting point to test the concept and gather feedback from users, but to bridge
from PoC to MVP, several features need to be added to the application. For example, the way users
find trips could be improved by adding a functionality that would allows users to input the spots
they want to visit and an estimation of the time they have to do so, and then they would be 
provided with some paths satisfying their criteria. It could also be a good idea to add a 
functionality enabling users to enter the point they want to get to, and the application would
generate a path to get there by analyzing the paths already present in the database and retrieving
the pleasant places on the way. Additionally, the application could be improved by adding a more 
complete way of giving feedback on the paths and the spots visited. We could for example add a way
to write comments on paths and grade them on a scale of 1 to 5.

On a more technical side, the application could be improved by adding new ways to login. We would
also need to take the security and privacy of the various data generated in the application more
seriously. The performance of the application could also be improved by optimizing the way the
paths are stored and retrieved from the database.
