*Describe the V1 POC as planned by Sprint10.*

The v1 Proof of Concept (PoC) for TripAdvisor build during the semester is a mobile application that 
allow users to create walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city. The application offers 
a social and interactive platform where users can record their own paths, add points of interest, 
and share their recorded paths with other users. It also proposes a following system to enable users 
to connect with their friends and share their paths with them.

The PoC was designed to enhance the experience of visiting a city by providing users with pleasant 
walking itineraries around spots of interest.

*What did you learn?*

From the V1 Proof of Concept we learned several valuable lessons.

- Security and Privacy are crucial in an application. Triptracker uses some sensitive information such as email adress, surname and last name. These informations need to be kept safely in order to raise trust in application which is a crucial factor of attractivity.
- In the same idea of boosting attractivity, it is a need for us to listen to our user feedback on a regular basis. This feedback then needs to be discussed and adressed with pertinent updates that address the issues raised in the user feedbacks.
- An app that is not responsive and that feels clunky will have a terrible retention rate of users. In order to make sure that users keep using TripTracker, the app needs to be well optimized in order to present low response times on communications with the database in order to reduce loading times. It also needs tu use a responsive UI that presents up-to-date and reliable information.
- The user interface needs to also be fluid, with transitions to make the navigation nicer. It needs a well structured color scheme that helps hierarchize information. That color scheme should be consistend between the different screens to make it intuitive for the user. The UI needs to adapt to the settings of the user's phone (text size or dark mode) and to different screen sizes in order to reach as much users as possible.

*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

The PoC is a great starting point to test the concept and gather feedback from users, but to bridge
from PoC to MVP, several features need to be added to the application. For example, the way users
find trips could be improved by adding a functionality that would allows users to input the spots
they want to visit and an estimation of the time they have to do so, and then they would be 
provided with some paths satisfying their criteria. It could also be a good idea to add a 
functionality enabling users to enter the point they want to get to, and the application would
generate a path to get there by analyzing the paths already present in the database and retrieving
the pleasant places on the way. Additionally, the application could be improved by adding a more 
complete way of giving feedback on the paths and the spots visited. We could for example add a way
to write comments on paths and grade them on a scale of 1 to 5.

On a more technical side, the application could be improved by adding new ways to login. We would
also need to take the security and privacy of the various data generated in the application more
seriously. The performance of the application could also be improved by optimizing the way the
paths are stored and retrieved from the database.
