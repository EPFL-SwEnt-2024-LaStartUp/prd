# History

The v1 Proof of Concept (PoC) build during the semester is a mobile application designed to enhance
the experience of exploring a city on foot by providing enjoyable walking itineraries around 
interesting spots. Users can record and share their own walking paths, discover and follow paths 
created by others, connect with their friends and stay updated with trending routes. They can 
also download paths for offline usage by adding them to their favorites. The ultimate goal is to 
transform every trip into a memorable journey shared with the community.

From the V1 Proof of Concept we learned several valuable lessons:

- **Security and Privacy:** Ensuring the security and privacy of user data (such as email addresses,
names and birthdays) is crucial for building trust and attractiveness.
- **User Feedback:** Listening to and addressing user feedback is necessary for maintaining and
improving the application.
- **Performance and Responsiveness:** The application must be well-optimized with low response times 
and a responsive UI that provides up-to-date information to ensure user retention.
- **User Interface and User Experience:** The application must have a fluid, intuitive and 
user-friendly interface with consistent color schemes. The UI should adapt to user settings (such as
font size and dark mode) and different screen sizes to reach a broad user base.

To transition from PoC to MVP, several features need to be added to transition from PoC to MVP, 
including trip discovery improvements, user feedback integration and enhanced security and privacy 
measures. Additionally, it's essential to implement ways to modify already recorded paths, and a 
more complete mechanism to react to other users' paths. Another important enhancement is to make 
points of interest available outside of recorded paths, allowing users to find interesting spots 
even if they are not following a path. On a more technical side, the application could also benefit 
from additional login methods, performance optimizations and data management enhancements.
