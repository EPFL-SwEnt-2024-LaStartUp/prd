# Timeline/Resource Planning


## Execution Roadmap

The MVP development process is structured into 10 sprints, each lasting one week. Key tasks include 
project setup, development, testing, feedback incorporation, product pitching & advertising, and 
feedback collection & response. Additionally, we have identified four major milestones to help our 
team of seven assess progress. Each team member rotates through various roles, including UI/UX 
designer (using Figma), frontend developer, backend developer, DevOps architect, software tester, 
and marketing communications coordinator.

### Milestone 1

Project Technical Setup and App Design Prototype

- GitHub and Firebase setup.
- Figma mockups and user flow documents.
- Collection of the material3 UI elements that can serve as building blocks: text fields, buttons, 
menu bars, navigation bars, etc.
- Google authentication & Google maps integration.
- First version of the four main screens: Home, Maps, Record & Profile.
- Development of a major epic: the Record feature with the possibility to start a path record, to 
have your current path displaying on the map, and to save it with a description.


| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Kickoff, Setup & Design | Establish MVP scop and planning. Set up project tools (Android Studio, GitHub, SonarCloud, Firebase and Figma). Initial wireframes and screen designs on Figma. Configure the Google Auth.  |
| Week 2 | Application Skeleton | Implement the in-app navigation, the initial backend & frontend for the main tabs: Home, Maps, Record & Profile screens. |
| Week 3 | Interactions with Database & Functional Release APK  | Complete UI/UX designs, implement Firebase data integration, have path record feature, update UI per visual chart, and write unit tests. Build the APK. |

### Milestone 2

Advancements on Core Feature

- Development of a major epic: the Profile feature with the possibility to follow your friends, to 
have favorites and your own path, and to change your profile information or parameters.
- Continued integration and unit testing.

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 4 | Friends and Record features Development & Testing | Add logic and views for Friends, enhance the path Record so to have an end-to-end feature. Write remaining unit tests, check frontend-backend integration with Integration tests using MockK.  |
| Week 5 | Profile Customization, Filter search & Pinned places features Development | Update Figma and frontend-backend: design UI for Profile Edit screen, add filter search on paths feature in the Home screen, new add spot functionnality with pictures saved on DB. Unit testing.|
| Week 6 | Profile Feature Completion & UI/UX Enhancements | Complete the Profile feature: MyTrips, Favorites, Edit & Settings. Changes in Add Spot and Maps UI to improve UX. Configure redirections from Home to Maps on path click. Unit testing. |

### Milestone 3

New features to enhance the User Experience (UX) and Pre-Launch Preparation

- Implementation of a Recommender System for paths using flames.
- Adjustment of design and ratios for different screen sizes.
- Implementation of offline mode and privacy settings for path visibility.
- Code cleaning and refactor to prepare release and to lower complexity.

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 7 | Recommender System & Compatibility | Register new user on login and implement an ambiant user profile. Modify design/ratios to adjust to different screen sizes. Implement the Trend functionality with flames. Complete Profile with a view to the profile from other users. Miscellenaous bug fixing, performance & unit testing. |
| Week 8 | Offline mode, Privacy, Launch & Alpha Testing | Rework of the start trip to improve UI/UX. Add spot takes pictures in real time. Implement the privacy settings to select if a path is Private/Friends Only/Public. New Trending-Following views in Home screen.  Internet connectivity influences the navigation behavior to prevent crashes. Addition of dark mode. More bug fixes, optimizations and code cleaning. Refactor to lower cognitive complexity and unit testing. App Initial Deployment: monitor performance, collect feedback, and apply hotfixes. |

### Milestone 4

Launch and iterative feature development for Product-Market Fit (PMF)

- Final bug fixes for a complete and seamless user experience.
- Rollout app to alpha testers and prepare the marketing strategy.

| **Sprint/Week Number** | **Objective** | **Outcomes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 9 | Path Download, Polishing, First Feature Iteration & Beta Testing | Adding a path to favorites stores it in the user's phone internal storage for offline usage. From the feedbacks, many bug fixes, UI changes, DB optimization for speed & space, adding new ways to personalize the profile to optimize UX and gain trust.  |
| Week 10 | Full Deployment | Final tweaks and polishing. Launch marketing campaign (video and infographic elements), engage with press with a live keynote demonstrating the app to get new users. |

## Hardware Requirements during Development
The members from the TripTracker project develop, test, and execute the project on their own laptops. 
A minimum of 16GB of RAM (to run Android Studio), 50GB of available storage (Android Studio, Android 
SDK, emulator system images, etc.) on SSD or better, and WiFi are required. An Android phone capable 
of demo-ing the team's application is also useful for on-the-go testing and presentation purposes.
