# User Analytics and Acceptance

The primary goal of user analytics is to understand how users are interacting with the application. 
This includes tracking user behavior, preferences, and engagement metrics to optimize the user 
experience and drive user retention. By analyzing user data, we can identify patterns, trends, and 
areas for improvement to enhance the overall user experience and increase user satisfaction.


The key metrics to track for analyzing the success of the application are:

- **User engagement:** Track the number of unique users engaging with the app daily, monthly and 
yearly. This helps us understand active user counts and usage frequency. Additionally, records the 
average session duration, and the number of sessions per user per day, week, month and year.

- **Content engagement:** Track the number of itineraries recorded and shared by users, including 
their sharing settings (public, friends only or private). Monitor the number of points of interest 
and photos added to the itineraries. Also track the number of itineraries followed by users to 
understand engagement with the user-generated content. Analyze this data over different time periods 
to identify trends and patterns.

- **Social engagement:** Track the number of users connecting with others by following them. Monitor
friends addition, average number of following and follower per user, profile views and favorites 
addition. This helps us understand social interactions and engagement within the app.

- **User retention:** Track the number of users returning to the app after their first visit and 
those who stop using the app after a certain period. This helps us understand retention rates and
identify areas for improvement to increase user retention. Additionally, track reasons why users
stop using the app to identify potential issues and make necessary changes to improve the user
experience.

- **User satisfaction:** Track user feedback from the app store and other review platforms to 
understand satisfaction levels. Identify key points needing changes and functionalities that satisfy
users the most. This helps us understand how satisfied users are with the app and identify potential
improvements to increase user satisfaction.


To evaluate the success of the application, we will consider the following criteria:

- **User penetration:** Achieve at least 1,000 downloads in the first month and 100,000 downloads in 
the first six months. This helps us understand user interest and app performance in terms of 
acquisition.

- **User engagement:** Aim for 20% of users creating and following itineraries monthly. Ensure an 
average session duration of at least 5 minutes and at least two sessions per user per week. This 
helps us gauge active usage and content engagement.

- **User satisfaction:** Aim for a user rating of at least 4 out of 5 on the app store. This helps 
us understand user satisfaction and identify potential improvements..

- **User retention:** Aim for a 50% return rate in the first month and 70% in the first year. This 
helps us understand retention over time and identify areas for improvement.

- **Partnership:** Establish at least one partnership with a major travel or review platform in the 
first year. This helps increase app visibility and user base while validating the TripTracker 
concept's relevance and value.
