# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

The TripTracker application aims to target both tourists and locals who want to explore a city by 
foot, without having to search for hours for the best walking itineraries. Additionally, the 
application also targets professionals such as city managers or local business owners who want to 
promote their city. Tourist offices, museums and other local businesses could use the application to 
create and share walking itineraries around interesting spots in the city to attract more tourists 
and locals, thereby bringing more visibility to their city.

The key persona for the TripTracker application is the tourist who will follow paths. Tourists are 
the ones who are more likely to look for pleasant walking itineraries and local places of interest 
when visiting a city they have never been to before. They are also more likely to share their 
experiences with friends and family to keep them updated on their trips or simply to keep a memory 
of their trips.


The following scenarios describe how the TripTracker application can be adopted, used and shared by
tourists and professionals:

- **Adopt:** 
    - Tourists download the TripTracker application on their phone before visiting a new city. 
  They create an account and start browsing recommended walking paths to follow during their trip. 
  They can also save the paths they like to easily find them later in their favorites and even 
  download them for offline access.
    - We contact professionals such as city managers or local business owners to promote the 
  application by explaining all the benefits they could get from using it to attract more tourists 
  and locals. They try the application and see that it could be a great way to easily promote their 
  city and their businesses, encouraging them to keep using it, making the application more complete 
  and attractive for users.

- **Use:**
    - During their trip, the tourists use the application to follow walking paths around the city 
  and through various spots of interest. They can also record their own paths, add points of 
  interest, descriptions and photos to share with other users, especially their friends.
    - Professionals can use the application to create and share walking itineraries around their 
  businesses or the city to attract more tourists and locals.

- **Share:**
    - Once they have recorded an itinerary, the tourists can publish it on the application. They 
  will talk about TripTracker to their friends and family and motivate them to download the 
  application to share the paths they have recorded. 
    - Professionals will also share the application with other professionals to promote their city 
  and their businesses, thereby attracting more tourists and locals.


## User Stories and Key Features

- "As a tourist, I want to find walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city, so that I can 
make the most of my trip."

- "As a friend or a family member of travelers, I want to see the walking paths they have recorded,
so that I can easily stay updated on their trips."

- "As a local, I want to share my favorite walking paths with friends, so that others can enjoy them 
as well."

- "As a city manager, I want to promote my city by creating and sharing walking itineraries around
interesting spots, so that I can attract more tourists and locals."

- "As a local business owner, I want to promote my business by creating and sharing walking 
itineraries around my business, so that I can bring more visibility to my business and attract more 
customers."


The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the TripTracker application must include the following key 
features:

- **Path discovery:** 
Users can easily find walking itineraries around interesting spots around them or in another 
specified location. The path discovery feature is essential as it is the main functionality of the 
application. The goal is to provide users with enjoyable walking itineraries around interesting 
spots in a city without having to search for hours for the best paths, ensuring they make the most 
of their trips. On the main screen of the application, the paths are sorted by their flame count, so 
the most popular paths are at the top and can easily be found by users. This way, users can easily 
follow the most popular and pleasant paths. Users also have the possibility to discover the paths 
published by their friends to stay updated with their latest routes.

- **Path recording and sharing:**
Users can record their own paths and add points of interest, description and photos as they walk.
They simply start recording the itinerary when they begin walking, and can easily add points of 
interest with descriptions and photos along the way. Once they are done recording the path, they
can add a title and description to it and publish it on the application. Users can then decide 
whether they want to share their recorded paths with all users of the application, just with their 
friends, or keep them private by selecting the desired option in the settings. Path recording is 
important as it enables users to keep a memory of their trips, making it enjoyable to look back on 
their experiences. Additionally, it allows users to follow the same path again if they wish to 
revisit their favorite spots. Path sharing ensures the application features many possible paths to 
follow and that new paths are regularly added. Without this feature, the application would be just 
a simple navigation tool and paths would not be user-generated, removing the community aspect that 
is a strength of the application.

- **Social interaction:**
Users can connect with other users by following them and stay updated with the latest paths they
have recorded. The social interaction feature is important as it adds a community aspect to the
application. It allows users to share their experiences with friends and family and discover new
paths created by them. By allowing users to add other users' paths to their favorites, the
application creates even more interactions between users and ensures widespread usage. Users can log
in to TripTracker with their Google account and create a personalised profile with a profile picture,
username, and other options. They can then look up their friends' profiles and start following them.
By connecting with their friends, users can easily stay updated with the latest paths created by
their friends and share their own paths with them.

- **Offline access:** 
Users can download the paths they like by adding them to their favorites, allowing them to follow 
the paths even when they are offline. The offline access feature is important as travelers might not 
have access to the internet all the time. This feature ensures that users can view the paths they 
have saved offline and enjoy their trip without worrying about having an internet connection.
