TODO : maybe add a user story from the point of view of a city manager or a local business owner.


*Identify and prioritise the key features required.*

The key features required for the MVP are:

- Path discovery: users can find walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city and follow them
- Path recording: users can record their own paths and add points of interest, description and photos
- Path sharing: users can share their recorded paths with friends or the public
- Offline access: users can view the paths they have saved offline
- Social interaction: users can follow other users and follow and like their paths


*Justify the importance of each feature.*

- The path discovery feature is essential as it is the main functionality of the application.
- The path recording feature is important as it allows users to keep a memory of their trips, making it enjoyable to look back on their experiences.
Additionally, it allows users to follow the same path again if they wish to revisit their favorite spots.
- The path sharing feature is important as it ensures the application features a lot of possible paths to follow. 
- The offline access feature is important as people traveling might not have access to the internet all the time.
- The social interaction feature is important as it allows users to follow other users and stay updated with the latest paths.
