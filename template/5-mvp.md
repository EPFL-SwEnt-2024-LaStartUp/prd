# The MVP

## Personas and Scenarios

*Who are the target personas for this product?*

The TripTracker application aims to target both tourists and locals who want to explore a city by 
foot, without having to search for hours for the best walking itineraries. But the application also 
targets professionals such as city managers or local business owners who want to promote their city.
Tourist offices, museums and other local businesses could use the application to create and share 
walking itineraries around interesting spots in the city to attract more tourists and locals and 
bring more visibility to their city.


*Which is the key persona?*

The key persona for the TripTracker application is the user that will follow paths and especially 
tourists. They are the ones that are more susceptible to look for pleasant walking itineraries and 
local places of interest when visiting a city they have never been to before. They are also the ones
that will be more likely to share their experiences with friends and family to easily keep them
updated on their trips or even just to keep a memory of their trips.


*High-level scenarios to adopt, use and share the product.*

- Adopt: Tourists download the TripTracker application on their phone before visiting a new city.
They create an account and starts looking through recommended walking paths to follow during their 
trip. They can also save the paths they like to easily find them later in their favorites and even
download them for offline access.
We contact professionals such as city managers or local business owners to promote the application
by explaining all the benefits they could get from using it to attract more tourists and locals. 
They try the application and see that it could be a great way to easily promote their city and their 
businesses and keep using it, making the application more complete and attractive for users.

- Use: During their trip, the tourist uses the application to follow walking paths around the city 
and through the different spots of interest. They can also record their own paths and add points of
interest, description and photos to share with other users, and especially their friends.
The professionals can use the application to create and share walking itineraries around their 
businesses or the city to attract more tourists and locals.

- Share: Once they have recorded an itinerary, the tourists can publish it on the application. They 
will talk about TripTracker to their friends and family and try to motivate them to download the
application to share the paths they have recorded. 
The professionals will also share the application with other professionals to promote their city and
their businesses and attract more tourists and locals.


## User Stories and Key Features

make the most of my trip.

so that I can easily stay updated on their trips.

- As a local, I want to share my favorite walking paths with friends, so that other can enjoy them 
as well.

- As a city manager, I want to promote my city by creating and sharing walking itineraries around
interesting spots, so that I can attract more tourists and locals.

*Identify and prioritise the key features required.*
*Justify the importance of each feature.*

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the TripTracker application must include the following key 
features:

- **Path discovery:** 
Users can easily find walking itineraries around interesting spots around them or in another given
place.
The path discovery feature is essential as it is the main functionality of the application. The goal
is to provide users with enjoyable walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city without
having to search for hours for the best paths, and ensuring they make the most of their trips.

- **Path recording and sharing:**
Users can record their own paths and add points of interest, description and photos as they walk. 
They can then decide whether they want to share their recorded paths with all the users of the
application, just with their friends or keep them private.
The path recording is important as it is what enables users to keep a memory of their trips,
making it enjoyable to look back on their experiences. Additionally, it allows users to follow the
same path again if they wish to revisit their favorite spots. The path sharing is important as it
ensures the application features a lot of possible paths to follow and that new paths are regularly
added. Without this feature, the application would be just a simple navigation application and paths 
would not be user-generated, removing the community aspect that is a strength of the application.

- **Offline access:** 
Users can download the paths they like by adding them to their favorites. This way they can follow 
them when they are offline.
The offline access feature is important as people traveling might not have access to the internet 
all the time. This feature ensures that users can view the paths they have saved offline and enjoy
their trip without worrying about having an internet connection.

- **Social interaction:** 
Users can connect with other users by following them and stay updated with the latest paths they
have recorded.
The social interaction feature is important as it adds a community aspect to the application. It
allows users to share their experiences with friends and family and discover new paths created by
them. By allowing users to add other users paths to their favorites, the application creates even
more interactions between users and ensures that the application is used by a lot of people.
