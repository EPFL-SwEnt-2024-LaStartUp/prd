# Overview

**TripTracker is a mobile application designed to enhance the experience of exploring a city on foot 
by providing pleasant walking itineraries around interesting spots. 
Record and share your own walking paths, discover paths created by others, connect with your friends, 
and stay updated with trending routes. 
It's the ultimate travel companion that turns every trip into a memorable journey shared with the 
community!**

The TripTracker application goal is to simplify the way people explore places on foot. By providing 
users with enjoyable walking itineraries around interesting spots, this application ensures that 
users make the most of their trips. The application also allows users to record their own paths as 
they walk and add points of interest on the way. They can upload photos and descriptions of the 
spots they visit while recording their paths and when saving the path they can add a title and a 
description to it.

The application also offers a community aspect, as the recorded paths can be shared with other users 
of TripTracker. This way, tourists and locals alike can benefit from the experiences of others and 
discover new places to explore. It is also a social platform where users can look up their friends' 
profiles and start following them. By connecting with their friends, users can easily stay updated 
with the latest paths created by their friends and share their own paths with them.

Users can save the paths they like to easily find them later in their favorites. The itineraries 
added to this folder are automatically downloaded to enable offline access. This way, users can view 
the paths they have saved offline and enjoy their trip without worrying about an internet connection.


TODO: Add what features might be added in the future? Or in the history part when talking about what 
is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?
