# Analysis of the Situation

The TripTracker application does not have any direct competitor as it would be uniquely centered on 
finding pleasant walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city, providing a community functionality.
However, there are several applications that offer functionalities similar to the TripTracker application, 
but none of them integrates all these features in one place.

First, **Google Maps** allows users to find walking paths between two points and can highlight  
points of interest. However the walking paths are usually straight forward and not necessarily pleasant 
as they might be next to heavy traffic roads.

**TripAdvisor** enables users to find relevant places to visit in a city, but this is not the primary 
focus of the application. Moreover, it does not offer the ability to find walking itineraries around 
those places.

**Strava** allows its users to share their workout sessions with their friends. But it is mainly used
to record sports activities and lacks a focus on tourism and points of interest.

TripTracker combines these various functionalities into a single application, making it more convenient 
and user-friendly. It is specially designed to help users find walking itineraries around interesting 
spots in a city, while also enabling them to share their experiences with their friends. The integration 
of features into one cohesive platform sets TripTracker apart from its competitors.


There are several complementary products in the market that could be integrated with the TripTracker 
application to enhance its functionalities and user experience. For example, TripAdvisor, Google Ratings 
and Yelp provide users with reviews and ratings of restaurants, cafes, and other establishments in a city.
Those pieces of information could be integrated into the TripTracker application to help users find good places 
to eat or drink along their walking itineraries.
Similarly, various applications like Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia help users handle the logistic 
aspect of their trips, such as finding accommodation and booking flights. We could integrate these
applications to help users plan their trips more efficiently and have a seamless experience.
Instagram or Facebook allows users to share photos and videos of their experiences, which could be 
linked to the TripTracker application to provide visual content of the walking paths and spots of interest.

By integrating these complementary products, TripTracker could provide an even more enjoyable experience 
for its users, ensuring they have all the information they need to make the most of their trip.
