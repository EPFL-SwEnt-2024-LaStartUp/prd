# Analysis of the Situation

*What are the competing products in the market today?*

The TripTracker application does not have a direct competitor as it would be uniquely centered on finding pleasant walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city, while having a community aspect.
However, there are several applications that offer functionalities similar to the TripTracker application, but none of them integrate all these features in one place.

First, Google Maps allows users to find walking paths between two points and can highlight some point of interest. 
However the walking paths are usually straight forward and not necessarily pleasant as they might next to heavy traffic roads. 
TripAdvisor enables users to find relevant places to visit in a city, but this is not the primary focus of the application.
And it does not offer the ability to find walking itineraries around those places.
Strava allows its users to share their workout sessions with their friends. But it is focused on sports and lacks a focus on tourism and points of interest.
TripTracker combines these various functionalities into a single application, making it more convenient and user-friendly. 
It is specially designed to help users find walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city, while also enabling them to share their experiences with their friends.
The integration of features into one cohesive platform sets TripTracker apart from its competitors.


*What are the complementary products in the market today?*

There are several complementary products in the market that could be integrated with the TripTracker application to enhance its functionality and user experience.
For example, TripAdvisor, Google Ratings and Yelp provides users with reviews and ratings of restaurants, cafes, and other establishments in a city.
This information could be integrated into the TripTracker application to help users find places to eat or drink along their walking itineraries.
Similarly, various applications like Airbnb, Booking.com and Expedia help users handle the logistic aspect of their trips, such as finding accommodation and booking flights.
Applications like Instagram or Facebook allows users to share photos and videos of their experiences, which could be linked to the TripTracker application to provide visual content of the walking paths and spots of interest.

By integrating these complementary products, TripTracker could provide an even more enjoyable experience for its users, ensuring they have all the information they need to make the most of their trip.
