# Analysis of the Situation

*What are the competing products in the market today?*
There is no direct competitor to our product.
- TripAdvisor allows users to find relevant places to visit in a city. But it is not really focused on relevant places to visit in a city.
- Various applications as Google Maps allow to find walkable paths between two points. But the paths are not necessarily pleasant.
- Strava allows its users to share their workout sessions with their friends. But it has a focus on sports and not on tourism.
The TripTracker application would provide those three functionalities in one place. 
It would be focused on making it easier for users to find walking itineraries around interesting spots in a city, while being able to share their experiences with their friends.
